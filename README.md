# Diwali Sales Analysis

This repository contains a Python-based analysis of Diwali sales data. The analysis is conducted using a Colab notebook, leveraging libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` for data manipulation, exploration, and visualization.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze sales data from the Diwali season to gain insights into customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends. This analysis can help businesses understand which factors contribute to sales performance during this festive season and optimize future marketing and sales strategies.

## Data

The dataset used in this analysis is a CSV file named `Diwali Sales Data.csv`. It contains the following key columns:
- `User_ID`: Unique identifier for each customer.
- `Cust_name`: Customer name.
- `Product_ID`: Unique identifier for each product.
- `Gender`: Gender of the customer.
- `Age Group`: Age group of the customer.
- `Age`: Specific age of the customer.
- `Marital_Status`: Marital status of the customer.
- `State`: State of the customer.
- `Zone`: Geographic zone of the customer.
- `Occupation`: Occupation of the customer.
- `Product_Category`: Category of the purchased product.
- `Orders`: Number of orders placed.
- `Amount`: Total amount spent by the customer.
- `Status` and `unnamed1`: Columns with missing or irrelevant data.

## Key Steps in the Analysis

1. **Data Import and Cleaning**:
   - Imported the CSV file and examined the data structure.
   - Identified and dropped columns with irrelevant or missing data (`Status` and `unnamed1`).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized data distributions for different categories such as gender, age group, and product category.
   - Analyzed the relationship between customer demographics and purchase behavior.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Used `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to create various plots and charts, such as bar plots, histograms, and box plots, to uncover trends and patterns in the sales data.

## Conclusion

- The analysis provides insights into how different factors like gender, age, and occupation influence Diwali sales. These insights can be used to tailor marketing strategies and improve sales outcomes in future festive seasons.
- Married women age group 26-35 yrs from UP, Maharastra and Karnataka working in IT, Healthcare and Aviation are more likely to buy products from Food, Clothing and Electronics category
